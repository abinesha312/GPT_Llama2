                                                         standing Administrative Committee. The objective is to provide the university and
                                                         greater communities with a variety of distinguished lecturers and speakers that will
                                                         bring significant interest, visibility and added prestige to the University of North
                                                         Texas.
The Fine Arts Series began as the Lyceum Series in 1903 when UNT was North Texas Normal
                                                         College. The series has grown over the past century while never losing sight of its
                                                         purpose. In all our endeavors we hope to enrich UNT students' lives and provide a
                                                         higher quality of life here at North Texas. As the Fine Arts Series enters its 111th
                                                         season, we hope to entertain and educate our campus community by presenting an exciting
                                                         series of performing, visual, and literary arts events. All UNT Fine Arts Series performances
                                                         are presented free of charge to UNT students. In honor of the commitment that Dr.
                                                         and Mrs. Rawlins have for UNT students and the Arts, the students at UNT proudly propose
                                                         to rename this series The Mary Jo and V. Lane Rawlins Fine Arts Series.
 
The Union Art Gallery is an art space on the second floor of the Union that showcases
                                                         the creative endeavors and artistic output of the UNT student body, provide students,
                                                         faculty, staff, alumni, and campus visitors with meaningful encounters with the visual
                                                         arts, and cultivates skills related to exhibition, curatorial, and preparatory practices
                                                         for UNT students.
