During the Spring 2024 semester, UNT’s Counseling and Testing Services started a creative new group therapy option, Dungeons, Dragons, & Therapy (DDT),
                        designed to help students develop social skills, as well as manage anxiety and stress.
                        The nine-week, closed therapy group led six students through a short adventure in
                        Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). A similar program
                        from 2019 laid the groundwork for this new therapy group led by Jordan Richardson,
                        M.S., LPC, the Housing Counselor for CTS.
“My personal experiences playing D&D showed me the power of roleplaying and collaborating
                        with others,” said Richardson, who served as the Dungeon Master for the game. “In
                        personal games with friends, I have seen and experienced many moments of personal
                        growth, exploration and expression that have helped me and my friends grow as people.
                        There are many stories within the community of people who have experienced the same.”
Players took on the role of aspiring heroes competing for admittance into the Sunlit
                        Scions, the most famous guild of heroes in the land. The group worked together to
                        overcome three challenges, ultimately winning the competition and earning their place
                        among some of the greatest adventurers in history.
Participants ranged from first-year to graduate-level students, and all had little
                        to no experience with D&D or TTRPGs in general. DDT was designed to be beginner-friendly
                        to ensure that the therapy experience had as few barriers to entry as possible. Richardson
                        was assisted by a graduate student who helped to monitor the group's therapeutic progress,
                        as well as assisting with the gameplay experience.
Feedback from the first round of DDT group was overwhelmingly positive, with players
                        sharing that the experience was not only enjoyable but also helped to improve their
                        confidence and social anxiety issues beyond the group sessions.
“DDT allows students to fight monsters and overcome obstacles while indirectly confronting
                        the personal challenges they face outside of the game,” said Richardson. “Through
                        the game, they find that the fantastical heroes they portray are more like them than
                        they realized.”
The group’s experience was so great that they made plans to continue playing together
                        with their characters after the game concluded. CTS hopes to continue DDT moving forward
                        and is currently looking for Summer 2024 and Fall 2024 participants.

UNT is committed to providing a safe environment for all members of the university
                                       community and prohibits hazing by any student, student group or employee.
Hazing is any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off-campus, by
                              one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers
                              the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging,
                              being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership
                              in an organization regardless of whether the student victim may have consented to
                              or acquiesced in the activity. The term includes: 
UNT Hazing Policy 
 
Intimidation.   Harassment.   Violence.
UNT will discipline any student or student group found responsible for hazing. Sanctions
                              for students found responsible for hazing can include probation, loss of privileges,
                              suspension, or expulsion. Sanctions for student groups can include probation, loss
                              of privilege, and suspension. Students and student groups can also be assigned educational
                              sanctions designed to change behavior and reduce the risk of future misconduct.
When hazing happens within a student group, UNT may find both the student group and
                              individual students responsible. A student group can be found responsible if it condones
                              or encourages hazing, or if its officers, members, or alumni commit or assist in the
                              commission of hazing.

Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
Dear UNT faculty and staff, 
As a public institution of higher learning, we have a responsibility to set a high standard for integrity and ethical conduct. Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
The university has a robust compliance and ethics program including policies, procedures, and training to help us all make ethical decisions. This program is designed to promote a culture of integrity and accountability, and to provide guidance in how to achieve this goal. Ethical decision making guidance can be found in UNT’s online course on Ethics and Standards of Conduct, which must be reviewed annually. 
One way you can help is to report possible instances of unethical or illegal misconduct. If you have information of fraud, waste, or abusive activities involving any university faculty member, employee, student, or other affiliate, you should report it right away. Examples include conflicts of interest, discrimination, fraud, misuse of university resources or information, NCAA violations, theft, or violations of safety rules or environmental laws.
We encourage you to first discuss any concerns with your supervisor or manager, but if you do not feel comfortable doing this, you can make a report through the UNT Trust Line.
The UNT Trust Line is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through an independent third-party vendor. Reports can be made online, by phone at 1-877-606-9187, or by texting "Hello" to 940-340-5156 and can be anonymous.  All reports will be reviewed by the University Integrity and Compliance office and, as appropriate, investigated by the university. UNT does not tolerate retaliatory action taken toward any person who, in good faith, reports, seeks guidance regarding compliance concerns, or participates in a compliance-related investigation.
UNT intends to cultivate an environment where open, honest communication is the expectation.  If you have questions, please contact University Integrity and Compliance at [email protected] or 940-565-4142. 
Thank you for the service you provide to UNT, our students, and our community. 
 
UNT Proud, 
Neal Smatresk

Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Notice do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites.

Despite these measures, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Any content you post or input you provide while using our Products is at your own risk.
Please be aware that the personal information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your county, and personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities in those jurisdictions.

If you are a Technology Provider, we may collect information from you concerning your Educational Tools. Any information you provide concerning the Educational Tools may be shared with other users of the Platform.
Cookies and Other Similar Technologies. We use cookies to help us understand how individuals utilize our Platform and to help us improve the quality of our Platform, including for storing user preferences, improving search results, and tracking user trends, such as how individuals use our Platform.
When you access the Platform we automatically record certain information, such as your web request, your interaction with the Platform, IP address, browser type, browser language, device type, operating system, and device ID. We use this information for troubleshooting and security monitoring.
As you interact with the Platform, we obtain information regarding your interactions, such as time of day and date, how long you spend on different pages; some of this information is collected via cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.

User Communications. When you send communications to us or to other users through the Platform, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Platform.

This section applies only if your Academic Institution uses IMPACT. The IMPACT module of the Platform (“IMPACT”) is an optional tool that integrates data from multiple sources including student demographic information, product usage, and student achievement data to produce evidence-based reports and dashboards on product effectiveness. The data used in IMPACT are defined, approved, and controlled by the Academic Institution using IMPACT, and usage of IMPACT only happens at the direct instruction of -- and via direct involvement with -- the Academic Institution. IMPACT does not use any data collected via browser extensions. All data used for IMPACT are used only for the specific educational purpose defined by the Academic Institution.
We use information we collect to administer the Platform, to allow you and other users to use the Platform and to improve our Platform and as otherwise described above in Section 10.A.

Iâd give it an 4.5 if I could, but itâs not a four. Iâd like it if it was easier to figure out at first how to access other folders such as trash and draftsâor maybe Iâm just slow. I like how you can change what the slide function hasâI have it set to delete which is super helpful and I wish the apple mail app had. I use both apps with Microsoft OutLook for my school email. I also like the computer version as well. Both versions of the app can (and do) remind me of events I have in my Microsoft calendar (I forget their name, if it has one). This is really helpful as my high school is using teams during the whole pandemic-so I get reminded before school starts, towards the end of classes I dislike, and before lunch ends that I have class which is really helpful. Iâll also mention that you can turn this offâfor one or all eventsâand change the amount of time beforehand that it reminds you at (15 or 5 minutes beforehand for example).  I still will use google as my main email because I already amâit isnât better enough in the ways it is to change. I donât think it is worse per say that google/apple email apps/websites. Hope this helps!
In looking through other reviews, I noticed several, many, reviews that stated how bad the product was but that showed 5 star ratings. ????? It is frustrating to sit and wait several seconds to have my inbox loaded each time I select outlook on iOS. I have reviewed settings and see no correction for that. Am I downloading messages online each time data wise? When moving a message from inbox, it would be nice to have predictive folders shown as on the desktop. I have three major folders that get a lot of messages and it is a frustration to scroll all over each time. My spouse uses Apple Calendar on her phone and we have trouble she invites me on an appointment. I have tried to clear that up but canât. I would prefer the calendar app to be separate from the email to use in separate windows. Handling and setting up groups for emails is frustrating on all platforms. As I am now retired, I have no great operational demands that Mail canât handle so I might just go back to that. Dropping MS Office would certainly save some money. The app is not âBadâ, just adequate. Certainly, it is no joy to use but does not cause too much pain-except for that one group of about ten days of email that was lost. Never found those suckers. ðUpdate: 9/13Still simply adequate. I have approached my host to find out if I can move all mail from outlook to Mail.
I was recently forced to switch over to the Outlook app from the native Apple Mail app by my office. Couldnât be more disappointed. First, despite the fact that everything is set up to push new data, I will regularly open the app to watch a dozen or so new emails load right before my eyes. No notifications, no indication that I received new emails, nothing. And sometimes this can be a dozen or more emails at a time and from a half hour ago or more. Very frustrating. Then thereâs the issue of the default email font, which is basically the most unpleasant looking and unprofessional font that could have been chosen, that cannot be changed. Next we have the calendar, which is the least intuitive layout I can imagine. I can never tell when I have things scheduled for any particular day, because itâs just a garbled mess. The layout in Appleâs Calendar app is much, much, much better. And adding items to the calendar is equally frustrating. Adding attachments to emails is always a fun little adventure, as you never know where or how itâs going to add them to the email. The whole point of being able to access email on your phone is that itâs supposed to be quick and convenient, and this app if far from either of those things. Honestly, Iâm not even sure itâs worth improving this app, it would probably be better to scrap it and start all over. Save some time in the process and just copy Appleâs apps.

This article is for setting up your email account only! If you're having trouble using the Outlook for iOS app, please visit our FAQs for more self-help information.
If you have a work or school account that uses Microsoft 365 for business or Exchange-based accounts, there may be additional requirements set by your IT admin. For example, if you have a company-managed device, an on-premises Exchange server configured for basic authentication, or your company requires mobile app management for app protection. See the section Set up work or school accounts that have additional requirements below for specific instructions.

Some work and school accounts have additional security requirements before you can use Outlook for iOS. If you're not sure which of these situations applies to your work or school account, talk to your Microsoft 365 admin.
Once you begin the enrollment process, you should complete the process in its entirety since pausing for more than a few minutes usually stops your progress and requires you to start over. If this process should fail, you need to return to the Company Portal app to try again.
Open the iOS App Store. Search for and download the Intune Company Portal app.
Next, search for and download the Microsoft Authenticator app.
Follow the procedure in the Set up access to your company resources article to enroll your iOS phone or tablet.

Note: In case you are prompted for multi-factor authentication, please refer to Security info overview.
Open the Outlook for iOS app.
Notes: When a device is enrolled, managed apps – including Outlook – can be installed in a couple of different ways: 
You install the app from the Company Portal app
Your company may automatically install it during the enrollment process
If your account is found, tap Add Account.
Note: If your account is not automatically found, manually enter your company email address, then tap Add Account. 
Enter your email account password, then tap Sign In.
Your company may have also implemented controls that will require you to Register before you can proceed.  By registering, you are verifying your identity so the device can be validated by your organization. If prompted to register your device, tap Register.
After you open Outlook, your experience will be determined by a variety of factors including your company’s policy settings and whether you previously accessed corporate resources with your device. For example, you may be prompted to authenticate using the Microsoft Authenticator app. You may also be prompted to enter a PIN. Follow the prompts that appear on your device for your given circumstances.

If you're having trouble using the Outlook for Android mobile app, Open an in-app Outlook support ticket.
If you have a work or school account that uses Microsoft 365 for business or Exchange-based accounts, there may be additional requirements set by your IT admin. For example, if you have a company-managed device, an on-premises Exchange server configured for basic authentication, or your company requires mobile app management for app protection. See the section Set up Outlook for Android with additional requirements below for specific instructions.

Open the Outlook for Android app on your Android device.
Select Add Account to add one of your existing email accounts, or Create New Account if you want to create a new Microsoft account.
If you select Add Account, enter your email address and follow the prompts to authenticate the account.

If multi-factor authentication is enabled for your email account, follow the instructions to verify the account.
If you select Create New Account, follow the prompts to create the new Microsoft account.
Open the Outlook for Android app on your Android device.

If you are prompted to create a work profile during the enrollment process, refer to the Create a work profile and enroll your device in Intune article. Otherwise, follow the procedure in the Enroll your Android device in Intune article to enroll your Android phone or tablet.

If your account is found, tap Continue.
Note: If your account is not automatically found, enter your company email address, tap Add Account, then enter your password when prompted.

 Teo (Danielle) Keifert (they/them) is a learning scientist, researcher, educator, and assistant professor in the College of Education at the University of North Texas. Teo studies young children's brilliance and how to cultivate that brilliance in science classroom learning. They focus on children's practices for inquiry and making. These include resources like engaging in imaginative embodiment by acting like a creature with feet on the back of your head to explore anatomy, engaging in thought experiments like imagining standing in boiling water or becoming a water particle to explore states of matter, drawing to make sense of engineering challenges, and creating cardboard representations of important moments to story life experience.
Teo's work examines family culture as a context for young children's inquiring and making sense of the world. They have partnered with COVID-cautious families across the U.S. to develop co-observation methodologies toward more ethically and ecologically valid forms of research with children (Learning, Being and doing in Families Study, Spencer Foundational Small Grant, PI Keifert).
Teo broadens forms of supported sensemaking in classrooms through design-based research and professional learning partnerships; Teo has studies how mixed-reality technologies support young children's sensemaking in science through play and embodiment (Science through Technology Enhanced Play, National Science Foundation grant, PIs Enyedy, Danish), how to support elementary teachers to design for transformational learning for all learners, including multilingual learners (Representations for Teachers as Learners project, McDonnell Foundatioin grant), and how to design for pre-service teachers to make sense of their past learning through the lenses of expansive socio-cultural theories to (re)envision new possibilities for their future students (Equitable Science Sensemaking, National Science Foundation grant, PIs Pierson, Keifert, Jeong, Johnson, Henrie).

Texas is that state I call home. I’ve spent most of my life in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area with brief stints in Nashville, TN & San Diego, CA. I was fortunate to gain my master’s degree in counseling at the very young age of 21 from Vanderbilt University. But it took many more years to actually figure out what counseling is really about. Although I originally specialized in adolescents in the school setting, I was introduced to play therapy as a doctoral student at the University of North Texas. My training and experience in play therapy has been the guiding force for my professional growth and focus. I believe that the Child-Centered approach to working with children is aligned with my humanistic beliefs that all people are working toward self-actualization. My research agenda focuses on the quantitative effectiveness of play therapy, with a specific interest in school settings. I am an active member of the Association for Play Therapy and focus my work on demonstrating efficacy and disseminating information on play therapy. As part of my role in the UNT Counseling Program, I am honored to direct the Center for Play Therapy on campus. On a personal note, I have been married for 18 years to my college sweetheart. We are busy raising two boys, Elijah & Noah, who take up any free time that we might spend developing hobbies. I actively volunteer in both of our elementary and middle schools.

Dr. Anondah Saide is a developmental psychologist with a mixed-methods research approach. Dr. Saide’s research program spans two distinct but related areas. The first pertains to the complex interplay between culture and cognitive development. For example, Dr. Saide seeks to understand how family background influences children’s reasoning about religious (e.g., God), scientific (e.g., germs), and existential (e.g., death) concepts. By extension, Dr. Saide examines how cognitive biases may enhance or constrain the learning of cultural concepts.
The second area of her research program examines how cultural concepts become components of worldview commitments (e.g., political, religious, moral) in adulthood and the socioemotional correlates (e.g., anxiety) of those commitments. Dr. Saide's scholarship is committed to promoting transparency, diverse perspectives, and public engagement in the scientific process. Dr. Saide’s scholarship can be found in journals such as Cognitive Science, the British Journal of Developmental Psychology, the Journal of Cognition and Culture, and Frontiers in Psychology.

Michael Siller, PhD, is a developmental psychologist studying how children with autism develop and learn. He is particularly interested in learning that occurs in familiar daily routines and natural environments. His research includes descriptive longitudinal studies to understand developmental mechanisms, intervention trials to determine efficacy, and implementation science to make evidence-based practices accessible to providers in the community. Dr. Siller published the first pair of longitudinal studies to show that responsive parental behaviors reliably predict the long-term (16-year) language gains in autistic children. He also completed two clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of Focused Playtime Intervention, a parent-coaching intervention aligned with the Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI) framework. Further, Dr. Siller co-founded an inclusive, university-affiliated laboratory preschool focused on autism and developed professional development programs for community-based preschool teachers. As the Executive Director of the UNT Kristin Farmer Autism Center, Dr. Siller strives to integrate clinical and educational services, and aims to support the implementation of evidence-based practices in community settings. He envisions a world in which children with or at increased likelihood for autism can access interventions promptly and transition seamlessly between intense clinician-delivered interventions, inclusive educational settings, and supportive learning environments at home and in the community. Dr. Siller’s research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and numerous private foundations (e.g., Autism Speaks, The Far Fund, The Marcus Foundation). Dr. Siller co-edited the Springer Handbook of Parent Implemented Interventions for Very Young Children with Autism, and his articles have been published in leading journals.

UNT is committed to providing a safe environment for all members of the university
                                       community and prohibits hazing by any student, student group or employee.
Hazing is any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off-campus, by
                              one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers
                              the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging,
                              being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership
                              in an organization regardless of whether the student victim may have consented to
                              or acquiesced in the activity. The term includes: 
UNT Hazing Policy 
 
Intimidation.   Harassment.   Violence.
UNT will discipline any student or student group found responsible for hazing. Sanctions
                              for students found responsible for hazing can include probation, loss of privileges,
                              suspension, or expulsion. Sanctions for student groups can include probation, loss
                              of privilege, and suspension. Students and student groups can also be assigned educational
                              sanctions designed to change behavior and reduce the risk of future misconduct.
When hazing happens within a student group, UNT may find both the student group and
                              individual students responsible. A student group can be found responsible if it condones
                              or encourages hazing, or if its officers, members, or alumni commit or assist in the
                              commission of hazing.

Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
Dear UNT faculty and staff, 
As a public institution of higher learning, we have a responsibility to set a high standard for integrity and ethical conduct. Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
The university has a robust compliance and ethics program including policies, procedures, and training to help us all make ethical decisions. This program is designed to promote a culture of integrity and accountability, and to provide guidance in how to achieve this goal. Ethical decision making guidance can be found in UNT’s online course on Ethics and Standards of Conduct, which must be reviewed annually. 
One way you can help is to report possible instances of unethical or illegal misconduct. If you have information of fraud, waste, or abusive activities involving any university faculty member, employee, student, or other affiliate, you should report it right away. Examples include conflicts of interest, discrimination, fraud, misuse of university resources or information, NCAA violations, theft, or violations of safety rules or environmental laws.
We encourage you to first discuss any concerns with your supervisor or manager, but if you do not feel comfortable doing this, you can make a report through the UNT Trust Line.
The UNT Trust Line is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through an independent third-party vendor. Reports can be made online, by phone at 1-877-606-9187, or by texting "Hello" to 940-340-5156 and can be anonymous.  All reports will be reviewed by the University Integrity and Compliance office and, as appropriate, investigated by the university. UNT does not tolerate retaliatory action taken toward any person who, in good faith, reports, seeks guidance regarding compliance concerns, or participates in a compliance-related investigation.
UNT intends to cultivate an environment where open, honest communication is the expectation.  If you have questions, please contact University Integrity and Compliance at [email protected] or 940-565-4142. 
Thank you for the service you provide to UNT, our students, and our community. 
 
UNT Proud, 
Neal Smatresk

UNT is committed to providing a safe environment for all members of the university
                                       community and prohibits hazing by any student, student group or employee.
Hazing is any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off-campus, by
                              one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers
                              the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging,
                              being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership
                              in an organization regardless of whether the student victim may have consented to
                              or acquiesced in the activity. The term includes: 
UNT Hazing Policy 
 
Intimidation.   Harassment.   Violence.
UNT will discipline any student or student group found responsible for hazing. Sanctions
                              for students found responsible for hazing can include probation, loss of privileges,
                              suspension, or expulsion. Sanctions for student groups can include probation, loss
                              of privilege, and suspension. Students and student groups can also be assigned educational
                              sanctions designed to change behavior and reduce the risk of future misconduct.
When hazing happens within a student group, UNT may find both the student group and
                              individual students responsible. A student group can be found responsible if it condones
                              or encourages hazing, or if its officers, members, or alumni commit or assist in the
                              commission of hazing.

Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
Dear UNT faculty and staff, 
As a public institution of higher learning, we have a responsibility to set a high standard for integrity and ethical conduct. Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
The university has a robust compliance and ethics program including policies, procedures, and training to help us all make ethical decisions. This program is designed to promote a culture of integrity and accountability, and to provide guidance in how to achieve this goal. Ethical decision making guidance can be found in UNT’s online course on Ethics and Standards of Conduct, which must be reviewed annually. 
One way you can help is to report possible instances of unethical or illegal misconduct. If you have information of fraud, waste, or abusive activities involving any university faculty member, employee, student, or other affiliate, you should report it right away. Examples include conflicts of interest, discrimination, fraud, misuse of university resources or information, NCAA violations, theft, or violations of safety rules or environmental laws.
We encourage you to first discuss any concerns with your supervisor or manager, but if you do not feel comfortable doing this, you can make a report through the UNT Trust Line.
The UNT Trust Line is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through an independent third-party vendor. Reports can be made online, by phone at 1-877-606-9187, or by texting "Hello" to 940-340-5156 and can be anonymous.  All reports will be reviewed by the University Integrity and Compliance office and, as appropriate, investigated by the university. UNT does not tolerate retaliatory action taken toward any person who, in good faith, reports, seeks guidance regarding compliance concerns, or participates in a compliance-related investigation.
UNT intends to cultivate an environment where open, honest communication is the expectation.  If you have questions, please contact University Integrity and Compliance at [email protected] or 940-565-4142. 
Thank you for the service you provide to UNT, our students, and our community. 
 
UNT Proud, 
Neal Smatresk
President

The University of North Texas has developed the Ethics and Standards of Conduct which sets out basic guiding principles for all employees.

The State of Texas maintains a linking policy governing the use of, copying information
                              from, or linking to a state website. UNT, UNTS, and UNTD abide by the terms of the
                              state policy and expects visitors to UNT component websites to do the same.
State Website Linking and Privacy Policy
Advance permission is not required to link to a UNT institutional website. The link
                              should be the full URL and not abbreviated. URLs on UNT institutional sites may change.
                              It is the responsibility of the owner of the website linking to the site to update
                              the link as needed. Owners of websites linking to UNT institutional sites may not
                              attempt to present UNT content as though it were their own. Websites linking to UNT
                              institutional sites should not duplicate content owned by the institution, but instead
                              should refer the reader to the original via a link. Content on UNT institutional websites
                              may be protected by trademark and copyright laws and may be used only as permitted
                              by laws governing intellectual property.
UNT institutions have a decentralized website creation and maintenance structure.
                              The owner of each departmental or organizational website includes links at his or
                              her discretion that are deemed to be relevant to the viewers of that website. Links
                              do not constitute endorsement by any UNT institution.

Instructure is committed to protecting the information we process by doing our best to ensure that the information is used only to support students and education. We are guided in this mission by our foundational Privacy Principles:
As part of our commitment to protecting the privacy of students, educators, and institutions, we are a signatory to the Student Privacy Pledge and a member of the Future of Privacy Forum.
Instructure has also earned the TrustEd Apps Data Privacy Certification Seal.
We invite you to learn more about the data practices on our platforms that enable lifelong learning.
Instructure, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Instructure,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) prepared this Product Privacy Notice (“Notice”) to describe our privacy practices. This Notice governs information collected and processed by our products and services (collectively, “Products”), which are listed here: https://www.instructure.com/product/all-products.

In the event that information is shared in this manner, notice will be posted on our website at www.instructure.com.
With your consent or at your direction. We may share information other than as described in this Privacy Notice with your consent, or at your specific direction, for example, if you choose to use the Products with social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.).
De-identified or aggregate use. We may share de-identified or aggregate information, that is information removed of specific identifiers so that it cannot singly identify you (i.e., non-personal information) for any purpose without limitation, unless prohibited by applicable law.

For example, educators and students can search publicly available YouTube videos, and embed videos into course materials. These services are only available if enabled by your Academic Institution.

You can learn more about how YouTube uses your personal information in the Google Privacy Policy.

Student Data Privacy Agreements.

Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Notice do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites.

You can find more details about our security program by visiting our security webpage at https://www.instructure.com/trust-center and reviewing our Security and Due Diligence Documents.
Despite these measures, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Any content you post or input you provide while using our Products is at your own risk.
Please be aware that the personal information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your county, and personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities in those jurisdictions.
Instructure complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Instructure has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.

This Section 10 applies only to users of the LearnPlatform by Instructure software, and any other extensions, mobile applications, software, or add-ons provided by us for use with LearnPlatform by Instructure (collectively the “Platform”)
We may collect the following types of information when you use the Platform.
Information you provide. When you sign up for the Platform, we ask you for some basic personal information, such as your name, email address, and Academic Institution. You may update or change your account or profile information through the Platform at any time. When you use the Platform, you may provide additional personal information at your sole discretion, including subject interests and grade level interests. As part of an Academic Institution, others in your Academic Institution and linked Academic Institutions may see your personal information and technology reviews.
If you are a Technology Provider, we may collect information from you concerning your Educational Tools. Any information you provide concerning the Educational Tools may be shared with other users of the Platform.
Cookies and Other Similar Technologies. We use cookies to help us understand how individuals utilize our Platform and to help us improve the quality of our Platform, including for storing user preferences, improving search results, and tracking user trends, such as how individuals use our Platform.
When you access the Platform we automatically record certain information, such as your web request, your interaction with the Platform, IP address, browser type, browser language, device type, operating system, and device ID. We use this information for troubleshooting and security monitoring.
As you interact with the Platform, we obtain information regarding your interactions, such as time of day and date, how long you spend on different pages; some of this information is collected via cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. We use this information to understand how your hardware and software interacts with the Platform and how we can better improve usage of the Platform.
If you or your Academic Institution have installed our extensions to your browser, we may automatically record certain information while the extension is activated, such as your username, the websites you visit, and the amount of time spent on each site. The extension records only application or website information on products that are included in the Platform’s product library as described below.
User Communications. When you send communications to us or to other users through the Platform, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Platform. We may use your email address to communicate with you about our Platform, including service-related notices.
This section applies only if your Academic Institution uses IMPACT. The IMPACT module of the Platform (“IMPACT”) is an optional tool that integrates data from multiple sources including student demographic information, product usage, and student achievement data to produce evidence-based reports and dashboards on product effectiveness. The data used in IMPACT are defined, approved, and controlled by the Academic Institution using IMPACT, and usage of IMPACT only happens at the direct instruction of -- and via direct involvement with -- the Academic Institution. IMPACT does not use any data collected via browser extensions. All data used for IMPACT are used only for the specific educational purpose defined by the Academic Institution.
We use information we collect to administer the Platform, to allow you and other users to use the Platform and to improve our Platform and as otherwise described above in Section 10.A. We will disclose information to our service providers that work on our behalf as described in Section 4.A., to provide the Platform.
Certain information and the reviews that you post to the Platform will be shared through the Platform and will be accessible to other users of the Platform. Please note once you have posted information to the Platform or communicated with another member of the Platform, we cannot control how other users may use the information you provide. Additionally, your Academic Institution may have access to your information, including as posted to the Platform, and may use such information in accordance with the Academic Institution policies.
Our Technology Providers do not have access to data you provide us or data we collect unless you expressly initiate such a request or expressly consent to such disclosure. If given permission, our Technology Providers may provide information about their educational tools and respond to requests from users.
If you are a Technology Provider and are using the Platform to respond to a request for proposal ("RFP") from an Academic Institution, we may collect the information you submit through the Platform and share that information with the designated Academic Institution.
We may use the information you provide through the Platform in response to RFPs in an aggregate and de-identified manner to provide aggregated and statistical data about such responses to our users and schools.
We may also create aggregated and statistical data about our users and/or Academic Institution and the use of the Platform. We may share or provide aggregated and statistical data, including reviews, to Academic Institutions, educational organizations, or Technology Providers.
We may also use de-identified or aggregated information to improve the Platform, including by sharing such information with our third-party collaborators and partners.
If you use the browser extension portion of our Platform, the Platform will collect information relating to your use and interactions with various websites accessed through your Chrome browser or your iOS device. Because the explicit purpose of the extensions is to help our customers understand how educational tools are used in their environments, the extensions collect general information only when you use sites related to educational tools that are listed on the Platform and included in the product library. You can review whether the extension is collecting information as follows:
The information collected through the extensions is not used to identify an individual student and is used only in aggregated form. For Academic Institutions that have a paid subscription to the Platform, the names of individual teachers can be listed on a per Academic Institution basis. We do not otherwise track or collect personal information about your online activities once you leave the Platform.

Iâd give it an 4.5 if I could, but itâs not a four. Iâd like it if it was easier to figure out at first how to access other folders such as trash and draftsâor maybe Iâm just slow. I like how you can change what the slide function hasâI have it set to delete which is super helpful and I wish the apple mail app had. I use both apps with Microsoft OutLook for my school email. I also like the computer version as well. Both versions of the app can (and do) remind me of events I have in my Microsoft calendar (I forget their name, if it has one). This is really helpful as my high school is using teams during the whole pandemic-so I get reminded before school starts, towards the end of classes I dislike, and before lunch ends that I have class which is really helpful. Iâll also mention that you can turn this offâfor one or all eventsâand change the amount of time beforehand that it reminds you at (15 or 5 minutes beforehand for example).  I still will use google as my main email because I already amâit isnât better enough in the ways it is to change. I donât think it is worse per say that google/apple email apps/websites. Hope this helps!
In looking through other reviews, I noticed several, many, reviews that stated how bad the product was but that showed 5 star ratings. ????? It is frustrating to sit and wait several seconds to have my inbox loaded each time I select outlook on iOS. I have reviewed settings and see no correction for that. Am I downloading messages online each time data wise? When moving a message from inbox, it would be nice to have predictive folders shown as on the desktop. I have three major folders that get a lot of messages and it is a frustration to scroll all over each time. My spouse uses Apple Calendar on her phone and we have trouble she invites me on an appointment. I have tried to clear that up but canât. I would prefer the calendar app to be separate from the email to use in separate windows. Handling and setting up groups for emails is frustrating on all platforms. As I am now retired, I have no great operational demands that Mail canât handle so I might just go back to that. Dropping MS Office would certainly save some money. The app is not âBadâ, just adequate. Certainly, it is no joy to use but does not cause too much pain-except for that one group of about ten days of email that was lost. Never found those suckers. ðUpdate: 9/13Still simply adequate. I have approached my host to find out if I can move all mail from outlook to Mail.
I was recently forced to switch over to the Outlook app from the native Apple Mail app by my office. Couldnât be more disappointed. First, despite the fact that everything is set up to push new data, I will regularly open the app to watch a dozen or so new emails load right before my eyes. No notifications, no indication that I received new emails, nothing. And sometimes this can be a dozen or more emails at a time and from a half hour ago or more. Very frustrating. Then thereâs the issue of the default email font, which is basically the most unpleasant looking and unprofessional font that could have been chosen, that cannot be changed. Next we have the calendar, which is the least intuitive layout I can imagine. I can never tell when I have things scheduled for any particular day, because itâs just a garbled mess. The layout in Appleâs Calendar app is much, much, much better. And adding items to the calendar is equally frustrating. Adding attachments to emails is always a fun little adventure, as you never know where or how itâs going to add them to the email. The whole point of being able to access email on your phone is that itâs supposed to be quick and convenient, and this app if far from either of those things. Honestly, Iâm not even sure itâs worth improving this app, it would probably be better to scrap it and start all over. Save some time in the process and just copy Appleâs apps.

For example, you may be prompted to authenticate using the Microsoft Authenticator app. You may also be prompted to enter a PIN. Follow the prompts that appear on your device for your given circumstances.

Philosophy 
The College of Applied & Collaborative Studies (CACS) prepares students to engage
                              with a rapidly changing environment through partnership and innovation. In collaboration
                              with industry partners in the DFW metroplex, CACS creates ongoing opportunities for
                              students to learn and grow in today’s workforce through project-based learning. Our
                              students work on real-world problems with industry leaders in a collaborative setting
                              that interweaves liberal arts, data analysis, project management, and design thinking
                              principles
 
 
Project Based Learning is the cornerstone of our curriculum and the student experience.
                                    Students work on a project based on real-world problems and needs that relate to the
                                    course content. These projects tend to span over a long period of time, possibly the
                                    entire semester. Our professors work with students throughout the project, sharing
                                    their areas of expertise and shaping their students into the leaders of tomorrow.

Texas is that state I call home. I’ve spent most of my life in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area with brief stints in Nashville, TN & San Diego, CA. I was fortunate to gain my master’s degree in counseling at the very young age of 21 from Vanderbilt University. But it took many more years to actually figure out what counseling is really about. Although I originally specialized in adolescents in the school setting, I was introduced to play therapy as a doctoral student at the University of North Texas. My training and experience in play therapy has been the guiding force for my professional growth and focus. I believe that the Child-Centered approach to working with children is aligned with my humanistic beliefs that all people are working toward self-actualization. My research agenda focuses on the quantitative effectiveness of play therapy, with a specific interest in school settings. I am an active member of the Association for Play Therapy and focus my work on demonstrating efficacy and disseminating information on play therapy. As part of my role in the UNT Counseling Program, I am honored to direct the Center for Play Therapy on campus. On a personal note, I have been married for 18 years to my college sweetheart. We are busy raising two boys, Elijah & Noah, who take up any free time that we might spend developing hobbies. I actively volunteer in both of our elementary and middle schools.

As a practicing athletic trainer for more than 10 years, she developed a clinical practice philosophy that involves collecting patient specific outcomes of each patient interaction and basing my clinical decision making on evidence and individual patient needs. As a result of her personal clinical philosophy, she utilized the same approach in teaching both athletic training and pre-occupational therapy students.
Scholarly dissemination of her patient care outcomes has been a priority in her career, as her evidenced-based action research peer-reviewed published manuscripts will show. Using that knowledge and proficiency in research and manuscript composition has also allowed for mentorship opportunities with athletic training doctoral candidates as well as serving as an expert committee member for masters level student research. Her experience using several advanced practice manual therapy techniques in her patient care and her strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS) certification both contribute to her clinical expertise in therapeutic intervention, rehabilitation and differential diagnosis.

Chancellor@untsystem.eduUNT System Building | 1901 Main Street | Dallas, Texas 75201
 
Michael R. Williams currently serves as the sixth president of the University of North
                              Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth (HSC) and the fifth Chancellor of the University
                              of North Texas System (UNT System). A Fort Worth native, and first HSC alumnus to
                              serve as President, Dr. Williams practiced anesthesiology and critical care medicine
                              in Texas for more than twenty years.
From 2008 – 2013, Dr. Williams served as Chief Executive Officer of Hill Country Memorial
                              Hospital – during which time the hospital received numerous state and national awards
                              becoming a Truven Top 100 U.S. hospital in 2012 and 2013. Under his leadership the
                              hospital was also awarded the 2013 Malcolm Baldrige National Presidential Best Practice
                              for Leadership Award and named a Top 10 finalist for the 2013 Malcolm Baldrige National
                              Presidential Quality Award. Hill Country Memorial Hospital went on to win the 2014
                              Malcolm Baldrige National Presidential Quality Award.
In 2011, Governor Rick Perry appointed Dr. Williams to serve on the University of
                              North Texas System Board of Regents. He was later appointed to serve on the Texas
                              Wesleyan University Board of Trustees in 2013.
Dr. Williams completed his anesthesiology and critical care training at the University
                              of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas and the Texas Heart Institute in Houston
                              following earning two medical degrees. Dr. Williams holds board certifications in
                              both anesthesiology and critical care medicine by the American Board of Anesthesiology.
A successful business executive and entrepreneur, Dr. Williams also holds an MBA from
                              Duke University and a Master’s in Health Care Management from Harvard University. Dr.
                              Williams has founded companies in several industries including health care, mortgage,
                              and software.
Dr. Williams has been named a Fellow of the American College of Health Care Executives
                              and a Fellow of the American College of Chest Physicians. In 2013, Dr. Williams was
                              named to the U.S. News and World Report’s Advisory Council for the Healthcare of Tomorrow
                              and remains an active member.
Under Dr. Williams’ leadership, HSC has embraced a values-based, collaborative, and
                              innovative team culture. During the COVID-19 pandemic, HSC stepped up for the DFW
                              community leading efforts on health literacy, contact tracing, testing and vaccinations.
                              Beginning his tenure as Chancellor of the UNT System in 2022, he is working to fulfill
                              his vision for the System through creating a unified team committed to being “One”
                              as an organization and developing stronger working ties in academics, research, and
                              across all campuses and disciplines.
Beyond his many accomplishments, Dr. Williams’ strong business acumen has encouraged
                              significant growth at HSC, all while never raising tuition during his tenure. Additionally,
                              during his first year as Chancellor, Dr. Williams announced there would be no tuition
                              increase at any campus across the UNT System for the upcoming school year.
Dr. Williams and his wife Ann have two daughters and two grandchildren.

The Board of Regents, the governing body for the University of North Texas System,
                              is composed of nine distinguished and dedicated Texans who are appointed by the Governor
                              and confirmed by the Senate. Regent terms last for six years and are staggered so
                              that three members are appointed every two years during the legislative session. The
                              Governor also appoints a non-voting Student Regent for a one-year term, beginning
                              on June 1 of each year. 
Throughout its history, the Board of Regents has been composed of ardent advocates
                              for excellence in quality of education, research, service and leadership, supporting
                              institutional and regional growth and success.

UNT is committed to providing a safe environment for all members of the university
                                       community and prohibits hazing by any student, student group or employee.
Hazing is any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off-campus, by
                              one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers
                              the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging,
                              being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership
                              in an organization regardless of whether the student victim may have consented to
                              or acquiesced in the activity. The term includes: 
UNT Hazing Policy 
 
Intimidation.   Harassment.   Violence.
UNT will discipline any student or student group found responsible for hazing. Sanctions
                              for students found responsible for hazing can include probation, loss of privileges,
                              suspension, or expulsion. Sanctions for student groups can include probation, loss
                              of privilege, and suspension. Students and student groups can also be assigned educational
                              sanctions designed to change behavior and reduce the risk of future misconduct.
When hazing happens within a student group, UNT may find both the student group and
                              individual students responsible. A student group can be found responsible if it condones
                              or encourages hazing, or if its officers, members, or alumni commit or assist in the
                              commission of hazing.

Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
Dear UNT faculty and staff, 
As a public institution of higher learning, we have a responsibility to set a high standard for integrity and ethical conduct. Our character as a caring institution reinforces this responsibility and is reflected in the ethical and honest ways we interact with students, the public, and each other. 
The university has a robust compliance and ethics program including policies, procedures, and training to help us all make ethical decisions. This program is designed to promote a culture of integrity and accountability, and to provide guidance in how to achieve this goal. Ethical decision making guidance can be found in UNT’s online course on Ethics and Standards of Conduct, which must be reviewed annually. 
One way you can help is to report possible instances of unethical or illegal misconduct. If you have information of fraud, waste, or abusive activities involving any university faculty member, employee, student, or other affiliate, you should report it right away. Examples include conflicts of interest, discrimination, fraud, misuse of university resources or information, NCAA violations, theft, or violations of safety rules or environmental laws.
We encourage you to first discuss any concerns with your supervisor or manager, but if you do not feel comfortable doing this, you can make a report through the UNT Trust Line.
The UNT Trust Line is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through an independent third-party vendor. Reports can be made online, by phone at 1-877-606-9187, or by texting "Hello" to 940-340-5156 and can be anonymous.  All reports will be reviewed by the University Integrity and Compliance office and, as appropriate, investigated by the university. UNT does not tolerate retaliatory action taken toward any person who, in good faith, reports, seeks guidance regarding compliance concerns, or participates in a compliance-related investigation.
UNT intends to cultivate an environment where open, honest communication is the expectation.  If you have questions, please contact University Integrity and Compliance at [email protected] or 940-565-4142. 
Thank you for the service you provide to UNT, our students, and our community. 
 
UNT Proud, 
Neal Smatresk
President

The University of North Texas Distinguished Lecture Series is chartered as a university-wide
                                                         standing Administrative Committee. The objective is to provide the university and
                                                         greater communities with a variety of distinguished lecturers and speakers that will
                                                         bring significant interest, visibility and added prestige to the University of North
                                                         Texas.
The Fine Arts Series began as the Lyceum Series in 1903 when UNT was North Texas Normal

          Let's get contenting! You'll receive a confirmation soon.
        
Creators should only upload videos that they have made or that they're authorized to use. That means they should not upload videos they didn't make, or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos made by other users, without necessary authorizations.
Copyright exceptions are laws that allow you to reuse someone elseâs copyright-protected material without getting their permission, but only under certain circumstances.
In the US, the most widely known copyright exception is fair use. When deciding whether a use is fair, courts look at four factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. Some activities that may qualify as fair use include criticism, commentary, and news reporting. Fair use aims to promote freedom of expression.
In some civil law countries, including many in the EU, more limited exceptions are recognized where the reuse must fall within specific categories, instead of having factors that are weighed. The categories set out in Article 17 of the EU Digital Single Market copyright directive are quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody, and pastiche. These words have their usual meaning in everyday language, but are also enacted into law by each member state and interpreted by both national courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). It is also important to consider the context of the use, and the purpose of such copyright exceptions, one of which is to balance creatorsâ freedom of expression, and rightsholders' copyright.
In some countries, such as Canada, the UK, and Australia, a hybrid concept of fair dealing exists. Courts weigh factors similar to those in fair use, but reuses must fall within specific categories. These categories include quotation (general quotation, and quotation for the purposes of criticism, review, or news reporting), caricature, parody, and pastiche.
Most countries in the world have signed an international treaty known as the Berne Convention, which allows reuses in specific categories, including for quotation, and news reporting.
While there are some similarities regarding copyright exceptions across the globe, there are still considerable differences between the laws of each country. Thereâs no one-size-fits-all answer as to whether a reuse falls within copyright exceptions, and the courts decide the applicability of such exceptions on a case-by-case basis.
At YouTube, our mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. Copyright exceptions play a key role in furthering this mission by supporting the free flow of ideas and creativity. Therefore, we ask rightsholders to consider the applicability of copyright exceptions before they submit copyright removal requests. We believe this would strike a balance between respecting the copyright of rightsholders, and creatorsâ freedom of expression that may be protected by copyright exceptions.
In addition, we build products that empower creators to access, create, and share information like never before. Weâve created an Audio Library for you to discover free high-quality music and sound effects that you can reuse safely. Now with YouTube Shorts, you can create short videos sampling someone elseâs content, provided they have given you permission to do so. We're also continuing to build and expand Creator Music, which lets creators in the YouTube Partner program safely use commercial music by licensing tracks or sharing their video revenue with music rights holders.
     Resources       Learn more about Fair Use        
Everyone has access to YouTubeâs Copyright Management Tools, which gives rights holders control of their copyrighted material on YouTube. We work with rights holders to match them to appropriate features based on the scale of their copyrighted content on YouTube, and the resources theyâve dedicated to responsibly manage their content online.  Our Copyright Management Suite provides a number of ways rights holders can make copyright claims.
The simplest way to have unauthorized copies of copyrighted content removed is by manually submitting a copyright notification through our DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) webform. This tool is best for most users - it is open to everyone, and available in every language.
The Copyright Match Tool uses the power of Content ID matching technology to find re-uploads of videos on YouTube. Available to over 1,500,000 channels, it identifies near-full reuploads of a Creatorâs original videos on other YouTube channels and allows the Creator to choose an action to take: they can request the removal of the video, message the uploader of the video, or simply archive the match if they do not want to take any action. Any user with a demonstrated history of successful DMCA takedowns via our webform can apply for access using our public form.
Content ID is our solution for those with the most complex rights management needs. It is our digital fingerprinting system that allows rightholders to upload content they have exclusive rights to as reference files, and then scans videos uploaded to YouTube for matches of that content. When a user uploads content, Content ID scans against the database for matching videos. If there is a match, then an action is taken based on the predefined rules or policies that a content owner sets themselves:
In most cases, this means that rights holders donât need to submit copyright takedowns for these videos and instead have the opportunity to monetize and run ads in exchange for the videos being live.
     Resources       Learn more about YouTubeâs Copyright Management Tools        Learn more about copyright strike        
If a copyright owner submits a valid DMCA complaint through our webform, we take down that video and apply a copyright strike. If a user gets three copyright strikes in 90 days, their account, along with any associated channels, will be terminated. We also have tools to help Creators resolve their copyright strikes - including waiting for it to expire after 90 days, requesting a retraction, or submitting a counter notification.
Content ID works differently. If a match between a reference file and a new upload is made, a âclaimâ is made. Based on the preference selected by the Content ID owner, weâll apply a policy to track, monetize, or block, but will not issue a copyright strike.

                              There are a few ways to get started on YouTube. We
                              offer up different formats and functionalities,
                              giving you the flexibility to create everything
                              from Shorts, which are vertical videos that run 60
                              seconds or less, to longer form videos.
                            

                              No matter what youâre creating, youâll need to
                              start by creating a YouTube Channel.
                            
Next, youâll want to upload your videos!

                              Growing your channel is all about creating videos
                              viewers want to watch and accurately presenting
                              them to the audience. When doing so, hereâs a few
                              tips to keep in mind.
                            

                              With each video, think carefully about the title,
                              description, and
                              thumbnail
                              you plan to use - these should all accurately
                              reflect your content and let viewers know what
                              they can expect from the video. If youâre a Shorts
                              creator, think about how the first 1-2 seconds of
                              your content can grab viewers scrolling through
                              the video feed!
                            

                              Once youâve got viewers watching, you can redirect
                              their attention via hashtags,
                              playlists,
                              cards,
                              end screens, and more.
                            

                              YouTube Studio is your home base for posting
                              videos and making edits to your channel. To update
                              your channelâs basic info like name,
                              profile picture, and banner, just log in and tap âCustomisationâ
                              to see your options.
                            

                              You can also make changes to your channel using
                              the Studio Mobile app. You can tap âYour Channelâ
                              and then âEdit Channelâ to update and edit how
                              your channel looks to your viewers. Note that you
                              can only change your channelâs name three times
                              every 90 days.

                              Promoting your videos is all about getting the
                              word out there. On YouTube, you can use tools like
                              cards, end screens, Stories, and Community Posts
                              to drive viewers to a specific piece of content!
                            

                              Off-platform, think about promoting your videos on
                              your socials and relevant communities, podcasts,
                              or platforms that align with your content and your
                              intended audience.

                              Our search and discovery systems are built to find
                              videos that match viewersâ individual interests.
                              We
                              recommend videos
                              based on things such as: what your audience
                              watches and doesnât watch, how much time they
                              spend watching, what they like and dislike, if
                              they mark a video as ânot interestedâ, and on
                              satisfaction surveys.
                            

                              So, rather than trying trying to find a secret
                              code to these systems, focus instead on making
                              videos that you think will resonate with your
                              audience. A great tool here is YouTube Analytics,
                              which provides data that can help you understand
                              how your existing content is performing and
                              provide insights for future videos!

YouTube has always had a set of Community Guidelines that outline what type of content isnât allowed on YouTube. These policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails. Our Community Guidelines are a key part of our broader suite of policies and are regularly updated in consultation with outside experts and YouTube creators to keep pace with emerging challenges.
We enforce these Community Guidelines using a combination of human reviewers and machine learning, and apply them to everyone equallyâregardless of the subject or the creatorâs background, political viewpoint, position, or affiliation. 
Our policies aim to make YouTube a safer community while still giving creators the freedom to share a broad range of experiences and perspectives.
You'll find a full list of our Community Guidelines below:
     Spam & deceptive practices       Fake engagement        Impersonation        External links        Spam, deceptive practices & scams        Playlists        Additional policies          Sensitive content       Child safety        Thumbnails        Nudity and sexual content        Suicide and self-harm        Vulgar language        
     Violent or dangerous content       Harassment and cyberbullying        Harmful or dangerous content        Hate speech        Violent criminal organizations        Violent or graphic content          Regulated goods       Firearms        Sale of illegal or regulated goods or services        
     Misinformation       Misinformation        Elections misinformation        Medical misinformation          Educational, Documentary, Scientific, and Artistic (EDSA) content       How YouTube evaluates Educational, Documentary, Scientific, and Artistic (EDSA) content        
In addition to Community Guidelines, creators who want to monetize content on YouTube must comply with Monetization Policies.
Each of our policies is carefully thought through so they are consistent, well-informed, and can be applied to content from around the world. Theyâre developed in consultation with a wide range of external industry and policy experts, as well as YouTube Creators. New policies go through multiple rounds of testing before they go live to ensure our global team of content reviewers can apply them accurately and consistently.
This work is never finished, and we are always evaluating our policies to understand how we can better strike a balance between keeping the YouTube community protected and giving everyone a voice.
           
500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Thatâs a lot of content, which is why our teams come together to make sure that what you see on our platform follows our Community Guidelines. To do that, we combine the power of advanced machine learning systems and our community itself to flag potentially problematic content. Our expert reviewers then remove flagged content that violates our Community Guidelines.
           
With hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to YouTube every minute, we use a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at scale. Machine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to find content similar to other content weâve already removed, even before itâs viewed.
We also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate problems before they emerge. Our Intelligence Desk monitors the news, social media, and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before they can become a larger issue.
The YouTube community also plays an important role in flagging content they think is inappropriate.
If you see content that you think violates Community Guidelines, you can use our flagging feature to submit content for review.
We developed the YouTube Trusted Flagger program to provide robust content reporting processes to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise in a policy area and government agencies. Participants receive training on YouTube policies and have a direct path of communication with our Trust & Safety specialists. Videos flagged by Trusted Flaggers are not automatically removed. They are subject to the same human review as videos flagged by any other user, but we may expedite review by our teams. NGOs also receive occasional online training on YouTube policies.
Sometimes videos that might otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may be allowed to stay on YouTube if the content offers a compelling reason with visible context for viewers. We often refer to this exception as âEDSA,â which stands for âEducational, Documentary, Scientific or Artisticâ. To help determine whether a video might qualify for an EDSA exception, we look at multiple factors, including the video title, descriptions, and the context provided. 
EDSA exceptions are a critical way we make sure that important speech stays on YouTube, while protecting the wider YouTube ecosystem from harmful content.

Machine learning systems help us identify and remove spam automatically, as well as remove re-uploads of content weâve already reviewed and determined violates our policies. YouTube takes action on other flagged videos after review by trained human reviewers. They assess whether the content does indeed violate our policies, and protect content that has an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose. Our reviewer teams remove content that violates our policies and age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. Reviewers' inputs are then used to train and improve the accuracy of our systems at a much larger scale.
       
If our reviewers decide that content violates our Community Guidelines, we remove the content and send a notice to the Creator. The first time a Creator violates our Community Guidelines, they receive a warning with no penalty to the channel. After one warning, weâll issue a Community Guidelines strike to the channel and the account will have temporary restrictions including not being allowed to upload videos, live streams, or stories for a 1-week period. Channels that receive three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated. Channels that are dedicated to violating our policies or that have a single case of severe abuse of the platform, will bypass our strikes system and be terminated. All strikes and terminations can be appealed if the Creator believes there was an error, and our teams will re-review the decision.

Sometimes content doesn't violate our Community Guidelines, but may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age. In these cases, our review team will place an age restriction on the video so it will not be visible to viewers under 18 years of age, logged-out users, or to those who have Restricted Mode enabled. Creators can also choose to age restrict their own content at upload if they think itâs not suitable for younger audiences.

                    YouTube TV is a live TV service that carries similar
                    channels as traditional cable or satellite TV (for example
                    NBC, FOX, ABC or ESPN). But unlike those services, it is
                    delivered to your TVs and devices through the Internet. You
                    don't need a satellite dish or other dedicated equipment to
                    use it. All you need is internet and a supported streaming
                    device, which can be on your TV. YouTube TV costs $72.99
                    per/mo, and NFL Sunday Ticket is an additional charge. Many
                    previous NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers have found they can
                    save money by switching to YouTube TV and adding NFL Sunday
                    Ticket vs what they paid last year. And if you want to check
                    out what channels YouTube TV has in your area, you can do
                    that here (link to zip lookup tool) If you don’t want
                    a new TV service and you are happy with your existing
                    service, you can buy NFL Sunday Ticket by itself from
                    YouTube Primetime Channels. You'll watch the games right in
                    the YouTube app on your supported devices.

Scholarships are a form of aid that help students pay for college. Unlike student
                     loans, scholarships do not have to be paid back and they may be combined with other
                     kinds of financial aid to cover up to the total cost of attendance.
UNT awards thousands of scholarships each year and not just to students who have earned
                           high grades or have high test scores.
In addition to academic merit, scholarships are awarded to students based on other
                        qualifications such as athletic ability or artistic talent.  There are also scholarships
                        for students who are interested in particular fields of study, who have extracurricular
                        achievements, who are members of certain groups, or who demonstrate financial need. 
Take some time and learn more about the types of scholarships available at UNT and
                        search for scholarships that match your interests and qualifications. 
Once you have been admitted to UNT,  create a profile in the Eagle Scholarship Portal  which will match you to scholarship opportunities based on your responses.

UNT is committed to providing a safe environment for all members of the university
                                       community and prohibits hazing by any student, student group or employee.
Hazing is any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off-campus, by
                              one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers
                              the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging,
                              being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership
                              in an organization regardless of whether the student victim may have consented to
                              or acquiesced in the activity. The term includes: 
UNT Hazing Policy 
 
Intimidation.   Harassment.   Violence.
UNT will discipline any student or student group found responsible for hazing. Sanctions
                              for students found responsible for hazing can include probation, loss of privileges,
                              suspension, or expulsion. Sanctions for student groups can include probation, loss
                              of privilege, and suspension. Students and student groups can also be assigned educational
                              sanctions designed to change behavior and reduce the risk of future misconduct.
When hazing happens within a student group, UNT may find both the student group and
                              individual students responsible. A student group can be found responsible if it condones
                              or encourages hazing, or if its officers, members, or alumni commit or assist in the
                              commission of hazing.

"La ceremonia de graduación La Raza con orgullo la hacemos para demostrar que los latinos
                           importan en UNT; que ellos se pueden superar, graduándose y ejerciendo sus carreras,
                           y tener mucho éxito junto con su familia. En esta ceremonia no solamente celebramos
                           al estudiante que se está graduando, pero celebramos al papá, la mamá, y a toda la
                           familia que ha estado durante toda la trayectoria del estudiante."
