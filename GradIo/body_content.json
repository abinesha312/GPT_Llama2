        "Mali Obomsawin is a Wabanaki bassist, composer, and songwriter who creates music that\n                        flies in the face of Western tropes insisting Indigenous cultures are monolithic,\n                        trapped in time. Instead, Obomsawin highlights centuries of clever adaptation and\n                        resistance that have fueled the art and culture of Wabanaki people. Raised on ancestral\n                        land in central Maine and in Québec on the Odanak First Nations Reserve, Mali Obomsawin\n                        is used to living between linguistic and political borders, but also recognizes the\n                        absurdity of such dichotomies. When studying jazz at Dartmouth College (founded as\n                        an Indian school in 1769 to educate Wabanaki people) with cornetist and co-producer\n                        Taylor Ho Bynum, Obomsawin came to find that the voices of their actual ancestors\n                        languished in the archives of the college: field recordings of Odanak's songs and\n                        stories kept locked away. As Obomsawin became a masterful bassist and immersed themselves\n                        in the tradition's history, they came to learn that many jazz greats themselves were\n                        Native, and indeed many of the core principles of American music, like the four on\n                        the floor beat or the swing of the drum, were influences by Indigenous musical ideas.\n                        Mali Obomsawin tells stories celebrating the many Indigenous musical artists who came\n                        before, who faced an unrelenting system and prevailed by crafting new ideas into new\n                        expressions of themselves.",

        "Policy Processes",

A typical review cycle for an uncomplicated policy action, e.g., a deletion or review without revision, may take twelve (12) weeks or more. The more complex the action, the longer the process will take. Occasionally, there might be an accreditation, system, state, or federal deadline by which a policy action must be complete. In that case, the UPO will communicate the need for urgency to all parties involved, and request expedited review to meet the required timeline.",
        "What happens to the policy once I submit my draft to UPO?",

A \"non-substantive change\" is a change to the policy draft document contents that does not affect the meaning and interpretation of the policy.  Examples of non-substantive changes include, but are not limited to: font and paragraph adjustments, page numbering, and policy number change.",

A flexible work arrangement is a privilege and not a right. The availability of flexible work arrangements is not intended to change university office hours or a department’s regular hours of operation, nor does it alter the responsibility or diminish the authority of supervisors to establish and adjust work schedules.",

You can elect to go “potluck” and accept a random roommate assignment.",

The LPC licensure was latter allowed to lapse due to a focus on methodology, but Robin still periodically works with counseling applications. More recently, Robin has completed a doctor of ministry (DMin) degree from Liberty University with a cognate in expository preaching and teaching.

He is particularly interested in learning that occurs in familiar daily routines and natural environments. His research includes descriptive longitudinal studies to understand developmental mechanisms, intervention trials to determine efficacy, and implementation science to make evidence-based practices accessible to providers in the community. Dr. Siller published the first pair of longitudinal studies to show that responsive parental behaviors reliably predict the long-term (16-year) language gains in autistic children. He also completed two clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of Focused Playtime Intervention, a parent-coaching intervention aligned with the Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI) framework. Further, Dr. Siller co-founded an inclusive, university-affiliated laboratory preschool focused on autism and developed professional development programs for community-based preschool teachers. As the Executive Director of the UNT Kristin Farmer Autism Center, Dr. Siller strives to integrate clinical and educational services, and aims to support the implementation of evidence-based practices in community settings. He envisions a world in which children with or at increased likelihood for autism can access interventions promptly and transition seamlessly between intense clinician-delivered interventions, inclusive educational settings, and supportive learning environments at home and in the community. Dr. Siller’s research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and numerous private foundations (e.g., Autism Speaks, The Far Fund, The Marcus Foundation). Dr. Siller co-edited the Springer Handbook of Parent Implemented Interventions for Very Young Children with Autism, and his articles have been published in leading journals.",

        "If you are a Spring 2024 incoming freshman recipient of the UNT Meritorious Scholarship for National Merit Finalists, Terry Foundation Scholarship, Texas Leadership Scholarship or a President’s Level or Dean’s Level UNT Excellence Scholarship, you do not need to complete an application—you are automatically admitted into the Honors College.",
        "Students that are not automatically admitted to the Honors College may apply to join the Honors College after being admitted to UNT. Once you have been assigned a UNT Student ID number and a UNT email, use the link below to complete your application.",
        "The first question on the application asks that you indicate whether you are an incoming freshman, a continuing student, or a transfer student.",
        "Incoming freshmen are often referred to as first time in college students.  If you graduate High School in Spring of 2023 (or plan to graduate in Fall 2023), and are not currently enrolled in classes at UNT or another institution, please select the Freshman designation.",
        "If you are currently enrolled in UNT classes, choose the Continuing Student designation.",
        "If you have completed one or more semesters of classes from another college or university, and have not yet taken courses at UNT, please select the Transfer Student designation.",
        "Incorrect responses to this question may delay the processing of your application. If you have any questions about how to complete the application, contact",
        "HonorsCollege@unt.edu",
        ".",
        "Before beginning, complete your written component (see below) to submit with your application. This file should be saved as Word or PDF documents.  Additional files (transcripts, etc.) are not required as the student academic record is available to the Honors Admissions staff",
        ".",
        "Example Written Component",
        "Your written component (double spaced, 250-750 words) should respond to",
        "one",
        "of the prompts below.",
        "The goal of the written component is for students to share with the Honors College Admissions Committee how their personal, academic, and professional experiences make them a suitable applicant for the Honors College. While students are permitted to utilize AI applications as a supplementary resource for outlining, proofreading, and idea generation, the primary responsibility for composing the written component remains with the student. Direct use of AI to generate the complete written component is prohibited and will be considered a violation of academic integrity policies resulting in the automatic denial of the student’s application.",
        "Briefly describe a piece of media (book, film, video game, etc) that has had a profound and lasting impact on you. How has it changed the way you view the world or yourself?",
        "Consider the critical lessons, advice, and philosophy that a current or former teacher/professor, coach, supervisor, or family member has imparted on you. Share how their influence has impacted your personal, academic, and/or professional career. Describe how you would take the principles learned from them to further your success at UNT and beyond.",
        "Imagine you had the opportunity to give a TedTalk about anything. What would your presentation be about?  Why is this topic important? What audience would you like to present to?",
        "Celebrities and influencers across the internet will occasionally showcase everything they do in a day. These ‘A Day in the Life’ videos allow viewers to gain a better understanding of who they are and what they do. Consider your own life and what you do then describe how you would showcase everything you do.",
        "Reflect on a time where you were faced with a challenge, obstacle, or roadblock, then share how you persevered to overcome it. What kept you going, what did you learn from this experience, and how has this shaped your own idea of perseverance in the face of adversity?",
        "Incoming freshman will also be asked to provide their high school GPA, class rank (if available), and ACT/SAT scores (optional).",
        "If you wish to explain anything in your application, you may submit an addendum. An addendum is appropriate if you think the admissions committee is likely to have questions about your application. For example, if you do not believe your academic records accurately reflect your ability to succeed in the Honors College, you may use an addendum to tell us why and to share what you believe indicates your potential. Addenda should be saved as Word or PDF files and uploaded with your other application materials.",

        "About the URF",
        "The Undergraduate Research Fellowship (URF) is an opportunity for students who wish to conduct guided research in their field of study, gaining invaluable experience, unique credentials, and a faculty champion. Students can apply this spring semester to earn a 2024-2025 URF Placement.",
        "The URF rewards students who enter—and show promise of significantly contributing to—faculty-led research environments. Such research will occur in a host of settings—whether in labs, or under individual faculty mentorship. The URF is a campus-wide opportunity open to undergraduate students of all majors.",
        "Students, in joint petition with their professorial research mentors, will undertake competitive application for a URF.  If accepted, Undergraduate Research Fellows will spend the academic year participating in research under the guidance of their identified faculty mentor. URF participants will receive a $500 award after presenting their research at the Scholars Day event in the Spring semester of the participating academic year.",
        "Students may reapply for an Undergraduate Research Fellowship on a yearly basis and can earn up to four such awards during their undergraduate career.",
        "Application Processing",
        "While the URF is a campus-wide opportunity, the processing of submissions occurs within the Honors College (students do not need to be Honors College members to apply). Because different disciplines define research and creative expression in varied ways, criteria for admission into research endeavors will remain under the auspices of our several colleges and individual departments.",
        "Students and their research mentors will be notified of the URF application outcome in the summer before the 2024-2025 academic year.",
        "Course Credit (Optional)",
        "The URF program does not require participants to take a corresponding course. If participants wish to earn course credit for their URF participation, they must pursue that option via other departments.",
        "Students who are members of the Honors College may choose to earn Honors College course credit for their URF participation by enrolling in the Honors Mentored Research course. Applicants who wish to do so should indicate on the application that, if accepted to the URF, they would like to be enrolled in a section of HNRS 2996/3996 Mentored Research. In order for URF participants to receive Honors College credit for their work, they must additionally submit a proposal for a Mentored Research experience to the Honors College.",
        "Please note that participation in the URF does not automatically award honors credit. For more details about earning Honors College credit for the URF, please reach out to",
        "HonorsCollege@unt.edu",
        ".",
        "Summary of Eligibility",
        "Applicants must be UNT undergraduate students, who will not graduate prior to May 2025.",
        "Incoming first-year TAMS students who have not yet started a semester at UNT are ineligible.",
        "In cases where faculty mentors already have grants to cover the cost of student assistants, the student may become an Undergraduate Research Fellow, but without further remuneration.",
        "Students are ineligible if they have already earned three Undergraduate Research Fellowships.",
        "Fellowship Requirements",
        "URF recipients must consistently participate in their research project, in accordance with the expectations set by their listed research mentor, for the entirety of the 2024-2025 academic year",
        "2024-2025 URF winners must present their research, in the form of presentations, papers, or a brief performing-arts production, on UNT Scholars Day in April 2025",
        "Students will lose their URF if they switch research mentors following the application period or if they fail to communicate on a regular basis with their research mentors. Only if a research mentor leaves UNT, or if health-related matters prevent mentors from continuing to supervise their students, will students gain permission to switch mentors or projects.",
        "Application Requirements",
        "In collaboration with their faculty research mentor, students must submit a 100-150 word statement describing their research project.",
        "Faculty mentors must participate in the upload application process, certifying that they are willing to mentor the student for the 2024-2025 academic year and confirming information relative to IRB/IACUC .",
