        "Finding a Job Is a Job in Itself",
        "Searching for a new job is hard work. In fact, it can be the toughest job you’ll ever have. The key to job search success is to treat the entire process like a business. To stand head and shoulders above the rest of the job-seeking crowd, it’s important to lay out an effective strategy. By defining what you want and need, you’re on your way to getting it.",
        "Know Yourself",
        "A successful job search begins with a strong understanding of who you are. See the “My Plan Assessment” for instructions on how to find out more about yourself, so you will know more about the types of positions you want, what you are qualified to do, and where you will be successful. Think about your short, mid, and long term career goals, then explore your skills and abilities, articulate your strengths, mitigate your weaknesses, and identify your priorities and values that will help you achieve them.",
        "Define What You’re Looking For",
        "What are your search criteria? Common search criteria are geographic location, application of skill set, connection to interest/passion, fit with work values, and compatibility with personality. Some people think it’s good to be ﬂexible in your job search, and to some extent it is. However, being overly ﬂexible can be a real hurdle. The more you can narrow down what you’re looking for and where, the more likely you’ll be able to uncover viable possibilities. It’s possible that you might have more than one thing you’re looking for though, and that’s ﬁne! If you can describe (to yourself and others) the kinds of opportunities you’re aiming for, you can organize your search appropriately. You may have diﬀerent methods that you use for different kinds of positions, organizations, ﬁelds, or geographic areas.",
        "Where to Look",
        "Diversity is important when it comes to your job search. Looking in a variety of places will assure that you are not overlooking any possible position postings. Look at online listings, like on the company’s website or on Handshake, at social media, like LinkedIn, at Professional Associations that are related to your field, and attend career fairs and expos, as well as other networking events that are offered on campus. See the “General Job Search Resources” and search by keyword or location. To search for jobs in Handshake, log in to your account, then click on “Search Jobs.” To find the schedule of networking events, click on “Events and Workshops.”",
        "Know Your Audience",
        "Research can make all the diﬀerence in your search. You need to look more like a great potential colleague than a desperate job seeker! There are plenty of desperate job seekers. It’s your job to do the research needed to understand your top employers’ needs and place yourself in situations where you can demonstrate your abilities. Researching the employer will also help you when it comes to writing your resume and cover letter, as well as in an interview.",
        "Quality Over Quantity",
        "Focus your energy on writing personalized cover letters, targeted resumes, and sending them out to companies hiring for position that you are qualified for. The closer a match, the better your chances of getting hired.",
        "Follow Up",
        "Following up with a company after you apply is a critical step in the job search. A call to the hiring manager can bring your name and resume to the top of the pile. Watch the “close date” on the job posting and wait a week after the deadline to give the company a chance to sort through applications. If there is no close date, one week after submitting your application is an appropriate amount of time to wait to follow up. Keep the tone of the conversation light and friendly and ask questions, if possible.",
        "Be Persistent",
        "Job searching is difficult, and there are times when you will be discouraged. Just keep in mind that everyone has been through the same grind at one point. Try to keep a positive attitude, and look at your job hunt as an exciting challenge.",
        "The Bottom Line",
        "The Internet should not be your only means of searching for jobs. Talking to people, asking questions, and being able to quickly and easily describe who you are (your interests, skills, experience) and what you’re looking for may be your best job search method. Conduct informational interviews and don’t be afraid to network!",

        "Applicant tracking systems are a software that manages the hiring process for companies. The ATS provides an interface for candidates to apply online and for managers and recruiters to view and search through those resumes. An ATS is a must have for companies of all sizes to streamline and automate HR responsibilities for a more efficient process. The ATS matches resumes with open positions in the system by searching the resume for keywords from the job description.",
        "Advantages for Job Seekers",
        "Applicants can better position their resumes by loading it with job-related keywords to take advantage of a system’s automated screening tool that index and crawl submissions. This might bring an applicant’s resume to the forefront, where otherwise it might have been overlooked through manual submission and review.",
        "Disadvantages",
        "If you are the type of candidate who skims through job descriptions and applies to every position a company has available with the same resume, the ATS will be your downfall.",
        "These systems aren’t designed with the candidate in mind. It will not accept skills that are “close” or “almost” what the position is looking for. If your resume does not have the specific words from the job description, the ATS will deny your application.",
        "Position Yourself for Success",
        "Follow these guidelines to ensure that your resume does not remain dormant in the database:",
        "Read descriptions more than once and get an understanding of what a company wants.",
        "Tailor your resume and job application to the specific job requirements referenced in the posting — emphasize your relevant experience and skills in the areas that are critical to that position.",
        "Add specific keywords into the application that are referenced in the job posting, so that applicant screening tools that index and crawl submissions for certain key terms and phrases will pick them up.",
        "Avoid using ornate fonts, italics, underline, columns, shading, shadowing, and graphics. Sparingly use vertical and horizontal lines. These can all cause problems for the system and it will not read your resume correctly. Use a normal font theme with boldface or all capital letters in plain black text.",
        "The best written resume isn’t as valuable as having contacts, a network and connections within a company. Optimizing your resume, focusing on keywords in the ATS interface and still getting out to network are the steps to finding a new opportunity.",

        "Congratulations! Your hard work has landed you a job or internship offer—or maybe even several to choose from! Even though you’ve got an offer or two in hand, your job or internship search is not complete. You may have many questions that will make the decision to accept or decline a difficult one. You may be asking “Is this the right job for me?” “Will I be happy working there?” “What will my career look like if I stay there for five years?” “Is the salary enough?” In the end, you’ll have to decide if you’ll accept an offer or not.",
        "EVALUATING AN OFFER",
        "Begin with an assessment of yourself, your needs, and desires. Ask yourself a few questions:",
        "What are my career goals? Does this job offer meet my aspirations and goals?",
        "What are my priorities and obligations, and will this job offer allow me to fulfill these needs?",
        "Does this organization meet my standards, morals, and values?",
        "Will this position offer me enough challenge to grow, learn, and develop new skills?",
        "Evaluate the Company:",
        "Begin by researching the position and learning everything you can about it. Evaluate the company’s current position in the industry and learn all about the organization.",
        "Benefits Package:",
        "Look for dental, vision, 401K, healthcare, and vacation/sick time options. Take into account that sometimes benefits can be so great that they outweigh a lower salary offer. Make sure that your benefits package has full coverage for the items you need and not just partial coverage. Consider your future plans: How will the benefits measure up to your future plans?",
        "Salary and Bonus:",
        "It is important not to accept or decline an offer based only on the salary. Take into account the benefits package and the salary growth potential within a company. Bonuses should not entice you into accepting an offer if you are not sure about working there. If the salary is lower than you expected, then there may be room to negotiate.",
        "SALARY NEGOTIATION",
        "If you conducted salary research and found that the offer is fair, you may decide to accept it. In other instances, you do not have enough information to know what the job’s worth or what its potential could be so you might decide to negotiate. Salary negotiation is an area that receives little attention but is an important part of the job search. Negotiations may be uncomfortable but can make a positive difference in your satisfaction with the position and the needs of the hiring organization. So, wait until they’re serious about hiring you. And when are you sure they’re serious? They’re serious when they make you an offer.",
        "Negotiation is a process, not a singular event! Keep in mind that the employer has chosen you from a pool of qualified applicants, so you are not as powerless as you think. Always begin by expressing genuine interest in the position and the organization, emphasizing the areas of agreement but allowing “wiggle room” to compromise on other areas. Be prepared to support your points of disagreement, outlining the parts you would like to alter, your suggestions on how this can be done and why it would serve the company’s best interests to accommodate your request. Back up your reasons for wanting to change the offer with meaningful work-related skills and positive benefits to the employer. Requesting a salary increase because you are a fast learner or have a high GPA usually are not justifiable reasons in the eyes of the employer. Meaningful work experience or internships that have demonstrated or tested your professional skills are things that will make an employer stop and take notice. Do not rush the process because you are uncomfortable. Once you have reached a conclusion with which you are both relatively comfortable, be sure to get a written agreement to allow any questions to be immediately addressed.",
        "Finally, please note that some entry level employees do not have a lot of latitude for negotiation, organizations are less likely to negotiate in slower job markets, and other employers have a policy of starting new employees at a set pay rate. If the employer chooses not to grant any of your requests, you will still have the option of accepting the original offer provided you have maintained a positive, productive and friendly atmosphere during your exchanges.",
        "ACCEPTING OR DECLINING AN OFFER",
        "The UNT Career Center encourages all students to be upfront and ethical in their actions with employers. To maintain your own professional reputation and that of the University, please adhere to these guidelines.",
        "When should I accept an internship/job offer?",
        "Students should receive a written offer with specific job title/location/salary/benefits. Do not accept an offer until it is in writing.",
        "If an organization gives you a verbal offer, request a written offer. An emailed offer is an acceptable offer.",
        "Is my offer binding once I’ve accepted an offer?",
        "Once you have accepted a position, stay firm in your decision. If you have signed a contract from an organization, they might have specific penalties for students who renege the offer. It also reflects poorly on you and will negatively impact opportunities for fellow UNT students if you renege on an accepted offer.",
        "What do I do if I’m juggling multiple offers?",
        "Prioritize what you are looking for in an internship/job and look at all aspects. Consider work-life balance, your commute, salary, supervisor, benefits, flexible hours, available promotions, and the future of the organization.",
        "What should I do if I’ve already received one offer, but I haven’t heard from my dream organization?",
        "Communicate with both parties.",
        "For the organization that has offered you the position, notify them that you are finishing up with the recruiting process and hope to make your decision by a specific date (usually no more than 2-3 weeks)",
        "Follow up with the dream organization to see if they have made a decision. Let them know that you’ve received another offer and are exploring your options.",
        "How long do I have to make a decision on the offer?",
        "You should not be pressured by an employer to accept an offer immediately. If you need to ask for more time, do so. Mentioning to the recruiter that you would like to take some time to review the entire offer package; which includes all benefits, will allow you a 3-5 day delay before accepting.",
        "Are there any consequences to reneging an offer?",

        "The Department of Labor estimates that up to 80% of positions are ﬁlled without employer advertising. If you are relying on job postings as your primary job search strategy, you’re only seeing approximately 20% of what’s out there. Networking is an informal discussion with people you already know, or have just met. Meeting people gives you an opportunity to learn from them. They can help you narrow your areas of career interests, give you inside information about the field, even help you find a job shadow, an internship, or a job.",
        "Who is in your Network?",
        "Your network is EVERYONE you know! It is also every person the people in your network know.",
        "How to Grow Your Network",
        "What are you doing right now to create or establish those important professional relationships? Here are a few ideas to help you get started:",
        "Meet with faculty or staff — especially a Career Development Specialist",
        "Attend employer information sessions, career fairs and expos, workshops, or other career events (visit “Events and Workshops” on the Eagle Network)Meet guest speakers or engage with your peers in class or through a student organization",
        "Talk with family, friends, and other acquaintances about their work",
        "Volunteer for a community service event or a charity organization",
        "Join a professional association related to your desired field and get involved",
        "Using Social Media for Networking",
        "The use of social media in learning about potential career paths, receiving feedback on job search documents (e.g., resumes), connecting with alumni, and networking with professionals in your ﬁeld of interest is becoming one of the most important avenues for a new generation of successful job seekers. Over 100 million professionals use LinkedIn to exchange information, ideas, and opportunities. Learn how to effectively build your proﬁle, connect with contacts, and ﬁnd opportunities.",
        "Tip",
        ": Search for and join groups based on interests and afﬁnities. Being members of a common group expands your network and gives you more professionals to connect with. However, do not rely solely on social media for networking, it is essential to get out and meet people that may be able to help you in your job search!",
        "Maintaining Your Network",
        "Effective networking is a two way street. Maintaining your network of contacts could benefit your career in the future, so it is important to stay in touch as well as offering up your assistance when someone else needs help. When you need a job, tap into your network to find opportunities. When you have found a position, be sure to notify your network and thank them for their assistance. Just remember to return the favor the next time someone in your network needs a new job.",

        "Wilderness First Responder (WFR) is the definitive course in medical training for outdoor educators, guides, SAR team members, and others who work or play in remote areas. The curriculum is comprehensive and practical, including all of the essential principles and skills required to assess and manage medical problems in isolated and extreme environments. The 5-day format is for individuals and sponsors with less time available for on-site training and requires 25 hours of pre-course preparation.",
        "All students must complete all pre-course work prior to arrival on course.",
        "Why Wilderness Medical Associates International?",
        "Curriculum",
        ". Based on nearly three decades of oversight and continual review by a faculty committee of medical practitioners, our curriculum is established, proven and is based on conceptual learning and critical thinking.",
        "Instructors",
        "are medical professionals who are in the field doing what they teach. They are required to complete rigorous training and bring an unprecedented amount of experience to the courses they teach.",
        "Courses",
        "devote significant time to practical sessions and realistic rescue simulations that prepare students for the stress of actual emergency situations in the field.",
        "Recognition",
        ". Teaching over 8,000 students annually, and having been teaching Wilderness First Responder and Wilderness EMT courses since the 1980's, we are the \"standard by which all other wilderness medical providers are judged.\"",
        "Description",
        "25 Hours Pre-Course Preparation and 45 Hours On-Site Training",
        "Class Format",
        "This course covers the same material and meets the same criteria as our standard Wilderness First Responder. It is designed for students and professionals who have tight schedules and the self-discipline to complete approximately 25 hours of pre-course preparation.",
        "Students will have access to the WFR Study Guide two to four weeks before the course starts. They are required to complete the assigned reading, case studies, study guide, and tests. The on-site instruction that follows reinforces and expands on the knowledge already acquired. Because students arrive familiar with the didactic material, on-site daytime training can focus on wilderness and rescue scenarios and practical skills. Evenings are reserved for study and assignments. Expect rescue scenarios with made-up victims and simulated wounds to prepare you for backcountry emergencies. Sessions may be videotaped for enhanced learning.",
        "The 5-Day WFR course has been through five years of development and testing. Conscientious preparation, studying, and time prior to the course is essential for success. This is not a short-cut version of our standard course. Established WMA International clients and other groups who are interested in this new format are encouraged to contact us about this offering.",

        "Prerequisites",

The experience of a game that satisfied our hunger for a new take on a tactical competitive shooter, similar to our experiences in CS:GO, was exhilarating. Combined with the timing of lockdowns and COVID, we had all the time in the world to frag.",

        "Mali Obomsawin is a Wabanaki bassist, composer, and songwriter who creates music that\n                        flies in the face of Western tropes insisting Indigenous cultures are monolithic,\n                        trapped in time. Instead, Obomsawin highlights centuries of clever adaptation and\n                        resistance that have fueled the art and culture of Wabanaki people. Raised on ancestral\n                        land in central Maine and in Québec on the Odanak First Nations Reserve, Mali Obomsawin\n                        is used to living between linguistic and political borders, but also recognizes the\n                        absurdity of such dichotomies. When studying jazz at Dartmouth College (founded as\n                        an Indian school in 1769 to educate Wabanaki people) with cornetist and co-producer\n                        Taylor Ho Bynum, Obomsawin came to find that the voices of their actual ancestors\n                        languished in the archives of the college: field recordings of Odanak's songs and\n                        stories kept locked away. As Obomsawin became a masterful bassist and immersed themselves\n                        in the tradition's history, they came to learn that many jazz greats themselves were\n                        Native, and indeed many of the core principles of American music, like the four on\n                        the floor beat or the swing of the drum, were influences by Indigenous musical ideas.\n                        Mali Obomsawin tells stories celebrating the many Indigenous musical artists who came\n                        before, who faced an unrelenting system and prevailed by crafting new ideas into new\n                        expressions of themselves.",

        "policy@unt.edu",

        "What is the difference between policy and procedure?",
        "A quick way to distinguish a policy from a procedure is that a policy states “Why” the institution takes certian positions on an issue, and a procedure outlines “How” the institution will implement this policy position. For a more detailed break-down of the difference, please check out our",
        "Policies v. Procedures Comparison Table",
        "page.",
        "On average, how long does it take to complete a policy action?",
        "If a change request is minor, such as a change in policy contact information or policy owner or contact, this can take a few business days. However, for substantive changes to the policy itself, the UNT",
        "Policy Processes",
        "involve six steps of thorough review.  They are a collaborative effort of Vice Presidents, the Office of General Counsel, and stakeholders. A typical review cycle for an uncomplicated policy action, e.g., a deletion or review without revision, may take twelve (12) weeks or more. The more complex the action, the longer the process will take. Occasionally, there might be an accreditation, system, state, or federal deadline by which a policy action must be complete. In that case, the UPO will communicate the need for urgency to all parties involved, and request expedited review to meet the required timeline.",
        "What happens to the policy once I submit my draft to UPO?",
        "The UPO will review and provide feedback or edits, if necessary. We will then initiate the routing process after confirming the policy draft meets prescribed standards and addressing any feedback concerns with the owner. Our processes are outlined in more detail in our",

        "page.",
        "Who do I talk to if I have a question about the content of a policy?",
        "The best person to address your questions pertaining to policy content is the Policy Contact listed on the policy's web page.  This page can be found by browsing or searching the",
        "Policy Manual",
        "for the policy-at-issue, and selecting the policy from the list.",
        "Where do I find the previously approved versions of the policy?",
        "UPO works closely with the Records Management Program and the University Archives to maintain the older versions of UNT policies.

        "What is the legal sufficiency review?",
        "The purpose of the legal review is to analyze policies to determine consistency with applicable law, identify and address legal risks, and improve legal defensibility.

        "Substantive vs. non-substantive change?",
        "A \"substantive change\" is a change to the policy draft document contents that affects the substance of the policy in a way that modifies meaning and interpretation of the policy. Examples of a substantive change include, but are not limited to: addition or deletion of a definition, change in a responsible party, change in applicability of policy, and a revision of text in the policy body which alters the scope of it applicability.  A \"non-substantive change\" is a change to the policy draft document contents that does not affect the meaning and interpretation of the policy.  Examples of non-substantive changes include, but are not limited to: font and paragraph adjustments, page numbering, and policy number change.",
        "How do I know when the policy was last updated?",
        "Each policy contains the initial approval date and revision history at the bottom of the document. If you would like to learn about recent policy updates, you may also go to the",

        "Program Concentrations",
        "Interdisciplinary Studies at UNT offers three ways to pursue your area of study while providing the academic rigor to help propel you into your professional or academic career. While a predefined recognized concentration provides more structure, the self-styled program allows you to pursue an intellectual interest not met by any specific degree program available. Each program requires 30 hours for degree completion from three different fields of study with at least 6 hours of credit in each field. No more than 18 hours (including thesis and special problem courses) may be taken under any one course prefix or subject field.",

        "Every day you record information about your life at UNT– in electronic\ndocuments, digital photographs and digital video. However, unlike a clay\ntablet, these digital artifacts will not survive in the long term unless we\ntake immediate steps to preserve them.",
        "Keeper is a web application that makes it easy to donate digital materials to\nthe University Archive where they can be preserved into the future. The UNT\nUniversity Archive collects materials related to UNT history, campus culture,\nand the student experience.",
        "How You Can Help",
        "Help us build the archive of the future by preserving a piece of your digital\nlife as a UNT community member—whatever that may be. You can submit anything\nfrom a selfie on your first day of class to a video on your graduation day.\nYou can even submit digital copies of physical items (like scans of photos or\nwritten documents) that you’re not ready to part with. This way you can hold\non to your memories while also adding them to the online archival collection\nfor others to experience. Nearly any digital file type can be donated through\nthe Keeper app. Images, documents, videos, and audio recordings are all\nwelcome contributions.",
        "Submitting materials to Keeper is easy. Follow the Keeper link below, and\nsimply drag and drop files from your desktop, or upload files directly from\nyour mobile device. Once files are added to the app, tell us a little about\nwho you are and what you are contributing to the archive. Helpful description\nincludes the date the material was created, the location, names of any people\nfeatured, and any other context to help archivists and future researchers\nunderstand what the material is and why it is relevant to our campus history.",
        "Archivists will review submissions for preservation. Then, the materials will\nbe made available online in the Portal to Texas History and the UNT Digital\nLibrary.",

        "Citing sources accurately is an important aspect of academic writing. Though citations may vary depending on the type of resource and writing style, the purpose of citations is to uniquely identify sources so that information can be shared easily and used ethically.",
        "The basic parts of a citation each help to identify the source and usually include elements such as author, title, publisher name and location, series information (volume, issue, or edition), date of publication, and location within the text or website. Additional elements such as a DOI or distributor may be added to further uniquely identify certain types of resources.",
        "Remember, if you are writing for a class or for publication,",
        "your instructor or publisher is always the final authority",
        "to consult for determining which style to use as well as for determining the proper format for a specific citation.",
        "Parts of a Citation",
        "Citations almost always have two parts. The embedded (or in-text) citation alerts the audience that an external source of information is present and points them to a specific entry on a comprehensive list of sources by uniquely identifying the work or creator.",
        "The list of cited sources, sometimes called a reference list or works cited page, is the second part of the citation. The list contains all information needed to accurately identify and access the same source that was cited within the body of the work.",
        "Both parts of the citation are important!",
        "When to Cite",
        "Anytime the work or idea of another is used it should be given proper credit through the inclusion of a citation.",
        "There are primarily two methods of using outside sources in your work, quoting and paraphrasing, and both methods require that a two-part citation be included in order to identify the source. When questioning whether or not to cite a source, consider the following:",
        "Is the information you want to use from the source a fact, figure, or idea?",
        "Is the information something that would not be considered \"common knowledge\"?",
        "Are you including the source's exact language, or presenting the concept in a identical way?",
        "Are you borrowing heavily from the source's material in order to form your own ideas?",
        "Are you using any part of an original creative work such as an image, sound, or clip?",
        "If the answer is yes to any of these questions, it is likely that a citation is needed. When in doubt, remember it is better to include a citation than to leave it out and risk plagiarism.",

Through \na combination of artistic examination, historical research, and religious understanding, I plan to evaluate the \nphysical information gleaned from these objects and how it can be best used in historical research regarding their \norigins. The project’s next stage involves digitally mapping the selected object’s journeys, carefully detailing \ntheir owners, unique aspects of their constructions, and the ways in which objects of similar formats compare, \nsimultaneously increasing their accessibility for a large user base.",
